## Overview

It can be a somewhat daunting task trying to get a handle on _AstroWind_ internals, and particularly various points of usage.

This page outlines and clarifies some of the techniques found in _AstroWind_. Use it as a guide for further modification, or an instructional for techniques to use in your own endeavors.

## Styling

As the name suggests, _AstroWind_ relies on _TailWind_ for styling. Furthermore, _AstroWind_ defines custom low level style settings which are incorporated into _TailWind_ seamlessly, and which provides consistency for higher level styling constructs, as well as enabling dark mode.

The styling mechanism consists of the following files (all paths are prefixed with `/src/` ):

<DListItem dt="assets/styles/tailwind.css">
  This file is essentially an extension of _TailWind's_ base.css. High-level component styles are defined here. Note
  also styling on elements selected by 'attribute' selectors at the bottom of the files, particularly those selected by
  'data' attributes.
</DListItem>
<DListItem dt="components/CustomStyles.astro">
  Defines custom colors and fonts. For these to take effect in the 'base.css' file, they need to be loaded in the html
  header section. See next.
</DListItem>
<DListItem dt="layouts/Layout.astro">
  This layout is used for all of the pages rendered by _AstroWind_. The contents of _tailwind.css_ and
  _CustomStyles.astro_ component, described above, is injected into the html header.
</DListItem>
